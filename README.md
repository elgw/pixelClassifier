# A pixel classifier

Inspired by Ilastic, this repo contains code to generate image features and then train and classify a 2D image in matlab.

Desirable features:
 - Parallelized classifier
 - Possibility to save classifier to disk
 - A suggested way to create the masks (why not gimp?)


## Files:
 - `px_gen_classifier` -- generate a classifier from an image and a label imabe.
  - `px_classify_image` -- classify an image (by name) using a classifier/model generated by `px_gen_classifier`.
