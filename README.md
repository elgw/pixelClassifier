# A pixel classifier

Inspired by Ilastic, this repo contains code to generate image features and then train and classify a 2D image in matlab.

Desirable features:
 - Parallelized classifier
 - Possibility to save classifier to disk
 - A suggested way to create the masks (why not gimp?)
 - Translate classifier directly to c-code?

## Implementation notes:
 - Uses the class `TreeBagger` in MATLAB for classification. There is also `templateTree`/`fitensebmle`, see [this comparison](https://se.mathworks.com/help/stats/ensemble-algorithms.html#bsxabwd).


## Files:
 - `px_gen_classifier` -- generate a classifier from an image and a label imabe.
  - `px_classify_image` -- classify an image (by name) using a classifier/model generated by `px_gen_classifier`. This function processes the image in tiles (with some overlap) so that it doesn't consume too much memory.
  - `px_classify_region` -- classify a image matrix. Used by px_classify_image.
